    //GENERAL EXPLANATION
    
    // There is a list of numbers and a target number that two different numbers from the list must add up to. The goal is to find out which numbers those are, and their respective index locations. So, to get the answer, we can test every combination pair of numbers in the list to check if they add up to the target number.

    // Some stuff to remember:
    // a + b = target; where c is target number, a is list number, and b is another list number
    // b will always equal target minus a.   b = target-a;
    // a will always equal target minus b.   a = target-b;

    // In this method, place each number from the list into a container that supports key:values(object) where we can list the number itself as the key and its corresponding index position as that keys value. These numbers (the keys) will represent candidates for the value of "a". So, to get the value of "b", we subtract target-a, as explained above. With the loop and if-statement, we test if any of those numbers in our object are equal to target-a. If true, whatever the index of "b" was during that loop iteration will be the second part of answer. And whatever the index of "a" was during that loop iteration is the fist part of answer. If there were no answer, this loop will effectively execute the comparison on every combination pair of numbers, which was the goal. The return statement stops the loop when the answer if found. If there is no answer, it returns "".
    // example:
    //nums = [a,b,c,d,e]; 
    // obj ={}     
    //first loop: check if target-nums[0] is equal to ANY number in obj nums = [a,b,c,d,e]  obj = {} 
    //second loop: check if target-minus nums[1] is equal to ANY number in obj; nums = [a,b,c,d,e]  obj = {a,1}
    //third loop: check if target-minus nums[2] is equal to ANY number in obj; nums = [a,b,c,d,e]  obj = {a:1,b:2}
    //and so on until every combination pair is checked or an answer is found.
